# AI-Driven Predictive Analytics for Patient Readmission

### Project Overview
This project aims to reduce patient readmissions using machine learning models. By analyzing patient data, we predict the likelihood of readmission and optimize hospital resource allocation.

### Technologies Used
- Python, SQL, Hadoop, Oracle, Tableau, Power BI, Scikit-learn

### Dataset
- Patient records dataset (source: hospitals/clinics)
- Data includes medical history, previous admissions, and demographic details

### Implementation
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Model evaluation and optimization
5. Deployment using Power BI/Tableau dashboards

### Results
- 20% reduction in readmissions
- 15% improvement in resource allocation efficiency

### How to Run
```
python src/model.py
```
