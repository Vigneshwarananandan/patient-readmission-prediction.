# 📌 Patient Readmission Prediction Project

This project clearly focuses on building a machine learning model to predict patient readmission using hospital data. It covers both Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

---

## 🚩 Project Goal
- Analyze patient data to identify key factors contributing to readmission.
- Clearly build and optimize machine learning models to predict patient readmissions accurately.

## 📊 Steps Clearly Followed
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Handling missing values, data preprocessing.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing and understanding data clearly.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Encoding categorical variables, feature selection.
4. **Modeling:** Building and evaluating logistic regression & random forest models.
5. **Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
6. **Evaluation:** Clearly evaluated models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
